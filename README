Starting to learn Erlang
========================

My idea is to create an irc bot written in erlang for the
purpose of learning erlang first, and then to use it on 
different irc channels.

Steps:
. connect to the irc server
. authenticate to nickserv
. join channel
. join another channel
. handle errors, disconnections and reconnections
. implement a !seen command
. implement loging to couchdb
. refactor code in more usefull chunks
. web interface (Yaws or Mochiweb) for basic status and control
. improve logging (tags, messages and events separatelly)
. web interface - implement log view

Commands:
!seen - replies when was someone last seen on the current channel
!tell - tell someone something when he appears online (or is not away any more)
!go - google search, feeling lucky, return title of result
!wiki - wikipedia == || ==

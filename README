Starting to learn Erlang
========================

My idea is to create an irc bot written in erlang for the
purpose of learning erlang first, and then to use it on 
different irc channels.

Steps:
+ connect to the irc server
. authenticate to nickserv
+ join channel
+ join another channel
+ handle errors, disconnections and reconnections
+ CTCP-PING, CTCP-VERSION
. implement a !seen command
. implement loging to couchdb
Â± refactor code in more usefull chunks
. web interface (Yaws or Mochiweb) for basic status and control
. improve logging (tags, messages and events separatelly)
. web interface - implement log view
. keep track of people entering and leaving a channel (away too?)
. handle 433 reply (nick not available)

Commands:
!seen - replies when was someone last seen on the current channel
!tell - tell someone something when he appears online (or is not away any more)
!go - google search, feeling lucky, return title of result
!wiki - wikipedia == || ==
!info - information about the bot: mem usage, uptime, channels, os type and version
help -> Hello, this is...
???

Database:
  {Nick, Channel} -> Status

  Status is:
    {present, LastActivity} -> from JOIN,PRIVMSG
    {away,    LastActivity} -> AWAY plus -^
    {notpresent, LastPresent, Message} -> from QUIT
